# Question 1

### Ever wondered, How do things like shots and fouls during a game affect who wins, and what if soccer matches ended at halftimeâ€”how would that change the game?

### What is the connection between in-game metrics such as shots on goal, fouls committed, and cards received, and the outcomes of soccer matches?

#### Approach

We choose relevant attributes such as shots, shots on goal, fouls committed, and cards both the home and away teams have earned. To guarantee the robustness of the model, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is then trained, and its effectiveness is assessed using an accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

## Exploring the complex connections between in-game metrics

::: panel-tabset
### Critical variables

-   **FTHG** and **FTAG** are crucial indicators
-   **FTR** serves as the target variable
-   **HS**, **AS**, **HST**,and **AST** reflect attacking performance.
-   **HF**, **AF**, **HY**, **AY**, **HR**,and **AR** all indicate team discipline and aggresion

### Data preparation

-   Combining match information with team-level season summaries
-   The consistency of the dataset ensures reliability of our analysis

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/soccer21-22.csv')

# Creating a binary target variable 'Result' 
# 1 represents a home win ('H') and 0 otherwise
df['Result'] = (df['FTR'] == 'H').astype(int)

# Feature selection
features = ['HS', 'AS', 'HST', 'AST', 'HF', 'AF', 'HY', 'AY', 'HR', 'AR']
X = df[features]
y = df['Result']
```

### Analysis

-   Splitting data into appropriate sets then applying regression techniques
-   Regression techniques, confusion matrix, and feature correlation heatmap
-   Discovering patterns and relationships critical for building predictive models

# Question 2

## What if the matches ended at halftime?

::: panel-tabset
### Critical variables

-   **FTHG** and **FTAG** are needed to determine team placements
-   **FTR** denotes the final actual outcome
-   **HTHG**, **HTAG**,and **HTR** are important as well
-   **HomeTeam** and **AwayTeam** combined with the rest help determine the winner

### Data preparation

-   Performing thorough checks and creating visualizations.
-   Making sure data has no missing values

### Analysis

-   Creating a function to determine results of matches at halftime and using this re-calibration as a new baseline of analysis.
-   Chronologically organized data

## Code

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
#| code-summary: "Data Prep & Pre-processing"
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/soccer21-22.csv')

# Function to determine the winner based on points
def calculate_points(row):
    if row['FTR'] == 'H':
        return 3
    elif row['FTR'] == 'D':
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

# Apply the function to calculate points for each match
df['HomePoints'] = df.apply(lambda row: calculate_points(row), axis = 1)
df['AwayPoints'] = df.apply(lambda row: 3 - calculate_points(row) if row['FTR'] != 'D' else 1, axis = 1)

# Aggregate points for each team
home_points = df.groupby('HomeTeam')['HomePoints'].sum().reset_index()
away_points = df.groupby('AwayTeam')['AwayPoints'].sum().reset_index()

# Combine home and away points
team_points = pd.merge(home_points, away_points, how = 'outer', left_on = 'HomeTeam', right_on = 'AwayTeam')
team_points['TotalPoints'] = team_points['HomePoints'] + team_points['AwayPoints']

# Sort team_points DataFrame based on TotalPoints
team_points = team_points.sort_values(by = 'TotalPoints', ascending = False)

# Create ranking DataFrame
ft_ranking = pd.DataFrame({
    'Team': team_points['HomeTeam'],  # You can choose 'HomeTeam' or 'AwayTeam' because they are the same after merging
    'Points': team_points['TotalPoints'],
    'Ranking': range(1, len(team_points) + 1)
})
```
