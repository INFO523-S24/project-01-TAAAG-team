# Question 1

## Exploring the complex connections between in-game metrics

Can these help forecast match outcomes?

-   Critical variables :
    - FTHG, FTAG, FTR, HS, AS, HST, AST, HF, AF, HY, AY, HR, AR.
-   Data preparation : 
    -  Combining match information with team-level season summaries. 
-   Analysis : 
    -   Spliting data into appropriate sets then applying regression techniques.

# Question 2

## What if the matches ended at halftime?..

Do certain characteristics seen in successful teams result in more wins?

-   Critical variables :
    -   FTHG, FTAG, FTR, HTHG, HTAG, HTR, HomeTeam, AwayTeam.
-   Data preparation : 
    -  Performing thorough checks and creating visualizations. 
-   Analysis : 
    -  Creating a funtion to determine results of matches at halftime and using this recalibration as a new baseline of analysis. 


## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
X = mtcars[['speed']]
y = mtcars['mpg']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
est2 = est.fit()
print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
