We examine the critical impact these variables play in deciding whether a home or away side wins using Evan Gower's painstakingly selected dataset. We examine these data and use logistic regression to forecast match outcomes, providing information about the dynamics of the game. This work opens the door for predictive modelling in sports analytics while also improving our knowledge of football strategy.\n\n## Introduction\n\nEvan Gower's work on Kaggle has made it possible to obtain statistics from 380 matches, giving us a detailed glimpse at the English Premier League season of 2021–2022. Along with comprehensive statistics for both home and away sides, such as goals, shots, fouls, and cards, it also provides important game information such team names, match dates, and referees. This dataset, which contains data on halftime performance as well as full-time results, is an invaluable resource for anyone wishing to examine the factors that affect football match outcomes, from individual player affects to team plans.\n\n## Question 1\n\nWhat is the connection between in-game metrics such as shots on goal, fouls committed, and cards received, and the outcomes of soccer matches? Can these metrics help in creating a predictive model to forecast whether the match results will favor the home or away team?\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe first query explores the complex connections between in-game metrics—like shots on goal, fouls, and cards—and how those relationships affect the results of football matches. Our goal is to use these factors to investigate if they can accurately forecast match outcomes that will benefit the home team or the away team. This question is especially fascinating since it addresses fundamental football dynamics and provides information on how different gameplay elements affect a team's eventual success or failure.\n\n### Approach\n\nFirst, we do a logistic regression analysis to see how in-game metrics might be used to predict a home team's outcome. We choose relevant attributes such as shots, shots on goal, fouls committed, and cards both the home and away teams have earned. To guarantee the robustness of the model, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is then trained, and its effectiveness is assessed using an accuracy score and a confusion matrix. We are able to measure the effect of every in-game indicator on the probability that the home team will win thanks to this scientific approach.\n\n**Data Preparation and Pre-processing** \nWe begin the data preparation step by loading the entire football dataset, which includes a wealth of match information from the 2021–2022 English Premier League season. We convert the full-time result (FTR) into a binary target variable called \"Result,\" where a \"1\" denotes a home team win, to make our analysis easier. Then, we choose crucial elements that could have an impact on how the game turns out, like shots, shots on goal, fouls, and cards both the home and away teams receive. We then divided the dataset into training and testing sets, which prepared the stage for creating and assessing our prediction model. The data is ready for perceptive examination thanks to this careful preparation.\n\n::: {#ea77b218 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/soccer21-22.csv')\n\n# Creating a binary target variable 'Result' where 1 represents a home win ('H') and 0 otherwise\ndf['Result'] = (df['FTR'] == 'H').astype(int)\n\n# Feature selection\nfeatures = ['HS', 'AS', 'HST', 'AST', 'HF', 'AF', 'HY', 'AY', 'HR', 'AR']\nX = df[features]\ny = df['Result']\n\n# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Logistic Regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predictions\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluating the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#c248c781 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Plot 1: Feature importance visualization\ncoefficients = pd.DataFrame(model.coef_[0], X.columns, columns=['Coefficient']).sort_values(by='Coefficient', ascending=False)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x=coefficients['Coefficient'], y=coefficients.index)\nplt.title('Feature Importance in Predicting Home Team Wins')\nplt.xlabel('Coefficient Value')\nplt.ylabel('In-game Metrics')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=817 height=671}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Feature Importance Visualization by Logistic Regression**\n\nA positive coefficient value (bar extending to the right) suggests that higher values of the corresponding metric increase the likelihood of the home team winning. For instance, a positive coefficient for `Number of shots on Target by Home Team (HTS)` indicates that the home side has a greater chance of winning if they have more shoots on target.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative coefficient value (bar extending to the left) indicates that the probability of the home side winning is decreased at greater levels of that statistic. For example, if `Number of redcards recieved Home Team (HR)` has a negative coefficient, it means that the home team's chances of winning are likely to be lowered by committing more red cards received.\n\n::: {#caa68c7a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Plot 2: Confusion Matrix\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix for Home Team Win Prediction')\nplt.xlabel('Predicted Label')\nplt.ylabel('True Label')\nplt.show()\n\n# Print accuracy\nprint(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=547 height=449}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nModel Accuracy: 0.78\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Confusion Matrix for Home Team Win Prediction**\n\nThis chart shows how well the model guessed if the home team would win a soccer game. It's like a report card for the model's predictions. For example, if the model guessed that the home team wouldn't win (maybe it thought the game would be a draw or the away team would win), and that was correct, that count goes in the top left corner. If the model thought the home team wouldn't win, but they actually did, that count goes in the bottom left corner.\n\nOn the other hand, if the model predicted a home win and was right, that goes in the bottom right corner. But if it predicted a home win and was wrong, that goes in the top right corner.\n\n::: {#d9d5e7cd .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define the target variable - Home win (1) or not (0)\ndf['HomeWin'] = df['FTR'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'H' else 0)\n\n# Select features of interest\nfeatures = ['HS', 'AS', 'HST', 'AST', 'HF', 'AF', 'HY', 'AY']\n\n# Compute correlation matrix for the features\ncorr = df[features].corr()\n\n# Heatmap of correlation between features\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=\".2f\")\nplt.title(\"Feature Correlation Heatmap\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){width=611 height=505}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Feature Correlation Heatmap** \nThis heatmap visualizes the correlation between different features (metrics) from the soccer dataset. Each cell in the heatmap shows the correlation coefficient between two features, ranging from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient close to 1 implies a strong positive relationship (as one feature increases, the other tends to increase), close to -1 implies a strong negative relationship (as one feature increases, the other tends to decrease), and around 0 implies no linear relationship.\n\nFor example, if 'HS' (Home Shots) and 'HST' (Home Shots on Target) have a correlation coefficient close to 1, it means that when the home team takes more shots, they also tend to have more shots on target. Conversely, if 'HS' and 'AF' (Away Fouls) have a correlation coefficient close to -1, it suggests that as the home team takes more shots, the away team tends to commit fewer fouls, indicating a possible defensive strategy or play style difference when under pressure.\n\n## Question 2\n\nHow do the outcomes of soccer matches vary under the premise that all games concluded at halftime? How does this disparity differ from team to team, and what is the influence of the overall outcome of the league championship?\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn question two, we analyze a hypothetical scenarios to offer practical insights derived from the European Premier League's 22nd season. By exploring how matches might end at halftime, we aim to analyze the real-world dynamics of team performance. Specifically, we will investigate whether successful teams exhibit early aggression in the first half or stage comebacks in the second half, and whether team rankings reflect consistent performance or fluctuate based on halftime strategies. This analysis offers practical implications for coaching strategies, player development, and tactical approaches, providing actionable insights to enhance team performance and strategic decision-making in professional football.\n\n### Approach\n\nInitially, we will employ traditional ranking methods based on full-time match results. Per the European Premier League, rank will be determined based on points per game, where a win is three points, a draw is one point, and a loss is zero points. When necessary, we will employ goal difference and total goals scored to determine team standings. Subsequently, we will simulate halftime outcomes for each match and recalculate team rankings using the same criteria applied for full-time results. An analysis will be conducted in two parts: first, comparing the disparities between the rankings derived from full-time and halftime outcomes; and secondly, focusing on the performance of the top three and bottom three teams in both scenarios to assess the influence of halftime outcomes on promotion, relegation, and the overall league championship. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to provide insights into the dynamics of soccer match outcomes and their implications for team standings and league competitiveness.\n\n**Data Preparation and Pre-processing** \nData preparation for the analysis of the 2021-2022 European Premier League (EPL) season began with the calculation of points awarded to home and away teams based on match outcomes, adhering to the EPL's point allocation system. Subsequently, the dataset was organized through grouping operations, which revealed instances of point ties among teams. To address this, a feature engineering process was employed to derive the goal difference metric, representing the difference between goals scored and goals conceded by each team. This involved aggregating match statistics to determine the net goals accumulated by each team throughout the season. By iteratively refining the dataset through these preprocessing steps, we ensured the readiness of the data for subsequent analysis, laying the groundwork for examining match outcomes and team dynamics during the 2021-2022 EPL season.\n\n::: {#calculate-full-time-rankings-based-on-points .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/soccer21-22.csv')\n\n# Function to determine the winner based on points\ndef calculate_points(row):\n    if row['FTR'] == 'H':\n        return 3\n    elif row['FTR'] == 'D':\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# Apply the function to calculate points for each match\ndf['HomePoints'] = df.apply(lambda row: calculate_points(row), axis = 1)\ndf['AwayPoints'] = df.apply(lambda row: 3 -
